;;; Commentary:

;; A minor mode that guesses the indentation offset originally used
;; for creating source code files and transparently adjusts the
;; corresponding settings in Emacs, making it more convenient to edit
;; foreign files.
;;
;; This hooks into many major modes - c-mode, java-mode, shell-mode
;; and ruby-mode, to name but a few - and makes an educated guess on
;; which offset is appropriate by analyzing indentation levels in the
;; file.
;;
;; Heuristics are used to estimate the proper indentation offset and
;; therefore this system is not infallible, however adjustments will
;; only be made if the guess is considered reliable.  This way it
;; should leave you off no worse than before.
;;
;; To install,
;;   (require 'dtrt-indent)
;;   (dtrt-indent-mode 1)
;;
;; The default settings have been carefully chosen and tested to work
;; reliably on a wide range of source files.  However, if it doesn't
;; work for you they can be fine tuned using M-x customize-group
;; dtrt-indent
;;
;; There is more extensive information in the dtrt-indent info page
;; which you currently need to install manually.
;;
;; Improvements over guess-offset.el:
;;
;; - Whereas guess-offset only worked for C, C++ and Java files,
;;   dtrt-indent supports plenty of major modes (Shell script, Perl
;;   and Ruby are worth mentioning) and is easier to adapt to other
;;   languages.
;;
;; - dtrt-indent is now a minor mode and can be switched on and off,
;;   both globally and locally (the latter using a File Variable).
;;
;; - dtrt-indent is more precise in analyzing the syntax of source
;;   files, making its guess more accurate (it now ignores lines in
;;   comments, multi-line expressions, here documents and the like.)
;;
;; - dtrt-indent stops analyzing a source file after a customizable
;;   amount of lines, making it operate faster on large source files.
;;
;; - dtrt-indent leaves alone files that explicitly set the
;;   indentation offset with a File Variable.
;;
;; - dtrt-indent comes with diagnostic functions to help you
;;   understand what it does behind the scenes, adapt it to new
;;   languages or fine-tune its parameters.
;;
;; - The name of the script has been changed to better reflect its
;;   purpose.
;;
;; - The customization group is now a child of the convenience and
;;   files groups instead of the tools group.
;;
;; - The customization variables are named more sensibly and are
;;   better documented.
;;
;; - Documentation is improved and no longer confusingly refers to
;;   "tab width" instead of "indentation offset".
;;
;; Files not touched by dtrt-indent:
;;
;; - Files that specify the corresponding variable
;;   (e.g. c-basic-offset) as a File Variable.
;;
;; - Files that specify dtrt-indent-mode: 0 as a File Variable.
;;
;; - Files for which dtrt-indent-accept-file-function returns nil.
;;
;; - Files with a major mode that dtrt-indent doesn't hook into.
;;
;; - Files for which the indentation offset cannot be guessed
;;   reliably.
;;
;; Limitations:
;;
;; - dtrt-indent can't deal well with files that use variable
;;   indentation offsets, e.g. files that use varying indentation
;;   based on the outer construct.
;;
;; - dtrt-indent currently only supports a limited number of languages
;;   (major-modes).
;;
;; - dtrt-indent only guesses the indendation offset, not the
;;   indentation style.  For instance, it does not detect whether a
;;   C-like file uses hanging braces or not.
;;
;; - dtrt-indent can't deal well with files that mix hard tabs with
;; - spaces for indentation.
;;
;; TODO:
;;
;; - verbose and diagnostics messages
;; - make sure variable documentation match their function
;; - make sure defaults are sensible
;; - complete info page
;; - bulk (real world) tests
;; - functional tests
;; - unit tests

;;; Change log:

;; Revision 0.2.0 (2008-03-25)
;; Major rewrite
;; Name change from guess-offset.el to dtrt-indent.el
;;
;; Revision 0.1.2 (2007-02-02)
;; Minor documentation cleanups
;; Added link to cc-guess.el
;; Applied two patches courtesy of Michael Ernst <mernst@alum.mit.edu>:
;; (1) The problem is that you wrote
;;     (- 1 bracket-level)
;;     where you probably meant
;;     (- bracket-level 1)
;; (2) The documentation for `beginning-of-buffer' says
;;     Don't use this command in Lisp programs!
;;     (goto-char (point-min)) is faster and avoids clobbering the mark.
;;
;; Revision 0.1.1 (2003-??-??)
;; Initial version

BEGIN-REGEXP is a regular expression matching the beginning of
the syntax construct in question.  NUM-GROUPS indicates how many
groups there are in BEGIN-REGEXP to be substituted in END-REGEXP.

END-REGEXP is a regular expression matching the end of the syntax
construct in question.  It can refer back to one group in
BEGIN-REGEXP using \1. Currently only one group is supported (\2
cannot be used.)

RECURSIVE-P indicates whether other syntax constructs can be
nested within this construct.  RECURSIVE-P is usually false for
comment and constant constructs, such as strings, and usually
true for bracketing constructs.

SKIP-REGEXP is a regular expression that, if matches, means that
END-REGEXP is ignored for that location.  This can be used to
prevent an escaped quote from being interpreted as the closing
quote, for example.")
